# Factory

This one looks very circumstantial, but is great if you want to show off.

## Building

Make sure you are in this example root directory (TheShortNamedNonOfficialCPPDesingPatternsHandbookReferenceRepository/factory)

Navigate to the desired example

```bash
cd example1
```

Buit it

```bash
cmake ..
make
```
