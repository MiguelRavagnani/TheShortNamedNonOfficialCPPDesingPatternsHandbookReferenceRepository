# Decorator

Simple in concept, not that simple in execution - but I love it. A decorator pattern, designed to change the behaviour of a component.

## Examples

 - Example 1 - Boilerplate class/inheritance
 - Example 2 - Bonkers weird template/variadic. I'm still not 100% sure how this works

## Building

Make sure you are in this example root directory (TheShortNamedNonOfficialCPPDesingPatternsHandbookReferenceRepository/decorator)

Navigate to the desired example

```bash
cd example1

mkdir build

cd build
```

Buit it (you should be inside {REPOSITORY_PWD}/TheShortNamedNonOfficialCPPDesingPatternsHandbookReferenceRepository/example1/build)

```bash
cmake ..
make
```
